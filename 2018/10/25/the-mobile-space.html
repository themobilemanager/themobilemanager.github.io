I was doing both backend and front end development at the time for a large online travel agency. The lead iOS developer at the time for the company, who also happened to be the sole iOS developer, decided to move on from the company, leaving quite the hole &amp; urgency within the engineering org. I was dabbling in my spare time making apps, learning the world of mobile. What really drew me to the native mobile space from a developer’s perspective was the clean and well thought out ecosystem provided.</p><p>Gone were the late minute discoveries of cross browser testing and finding functionality horrendously broken. Having numerous browser conditionals baked into the logic of the application to tweak for browser quirks, no more. Instead I moreso had to consider screensize differences, but the underlying api’s and behaviours were largely to be expected. This left me with more time to build features, instead of testing provider’s platforms.</p><p>Having spent the last 6 years in mobile development and managing mobile teams I thought I would discuss some of the benefits and gotchas of working in the mobile world that may differ from the concerns of behind the curtain. No doubt some of you are transitioning from these worlds into mobile.</p><h2 id="releases-are-timed-not-pushed">Releases are timed, not pushed</h2></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
